Justin has an amazing skill to deconstruct a tough coding challenge
          into granular pieces, and thereafter re-using the latter pieces in the
          most efficient manner to build out a modern web architecture. I loved
          his passion for coding, as well as his patience to explain concepts
          around javascript data structures and react components. The most
          interesting part is, he is only 20 years old! He has a very bright
          future ahead of him :) -dirk


Justin is an exceptionally capable coder who not only has a deep
          understanding of design patterns and a solid grasp on architecture
          fundamentals, but also can translate high-level concepts into robust,
          functional code. What impresses me the most about him are his
          practical approach to problem solving and remarkable curiosity. He is
          a very eager but disciplined learner who can tackle increasingly
          complex challenges. During the bootcamp, I have never seen Justin
          giving up on a coding challenge or even getting too swayed by it, he
          always keeps up an optimistic attitude and has confidence in his
          extraordinary problem solving skills, which help him work with
          incredible resilience and peace of mind under tight deadlines. I have
          seen him both excel in individual tasks and be a reliable team member
          who doesnâ€™t shy away from responsibility and often takes the lead,
          pushing his group forward, always ready to help whoever is falling
          behind with a contagious positive drive. I was very lucky to have
          someone as talented as Justin as a student!
