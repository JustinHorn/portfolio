        <p>
          Hi! My name is Justin and I like building smart and well designed
          web-applications. My interest in web development started back in 2020
          when I coded a desktop app named the "Dayplaner" and wanted to make it
          easily accessible to a lot of users â€” I already new how to code in a
          clean and scalable way, but I never really thought about UI/UX until
          confronted with HTML & CSS. <br /> <br /> By now I have completed a 15
          week web development bootcamp, worked at a startup and am currently
          working on the 3DfindIT app at my current medium sized Employeer
          CADENAS. <br /> <br /> In my freetime I like to learn new tricks and
          skills, I am interested in Entrepreneurship and work out on a regular
          basis.
